# **Demystifying AI: An Introduction to Intelligent Agents**

# What is AI?
•AI refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence possessed by humans and animals.
•It encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies that enable machines to perceive, learn, reason, solve problems, and act autonomously.

# A Brief History of AI
•The roots of AI can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy and writings about artificial beings.
•Modern AI research gained momentum in the mid-20th century with seminal works like Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" and the invention of the perceptron, a basic neural network model.
•Despite initial optimism, the field experienced periods of funding cuts and limited progress in the late 20th century.
The resurgence of AI began in the late 2000s and early 2010s, fueled by advancements in computing power, data availability, and algorithmic developments

# Types of Intelligent Agents
•Some common types include:
•Simple reflex agents: React directly to their environment based on predetermined rules.
•Model-based reflex agents: Build internal models of the world to make decisions.
•Goal-based agents: Have goals they aim to achieve and plan actions *accordingly*.
•Utility-based agents: Select actions based on their expected utility or value.
•Learning agents: Can learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time.
•Social agents: Interact with other agents and their environment in a social setting.

# Characteristics of Intelligent Agents
•Intelligent agents exhibit several key characteristics:
•Reactivity: Perceive their environment and respond to changes.
•Proactiveness: Take initiative and adapt their behavior to achieve goals.
•Socialability: Interact with other agents and their environment in a social context.
•Adaptability: Learn and adjust their behavior based on new information and experiences.
•Rationality: Make decisions that maximize their chances of success.
